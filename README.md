The goal of this project is to be a kickstart to your .Net WebApi, implementing the most common used patterns
and technologies for a restful API in .net, making your work easier.

# How to run
- Use this template(github) or clone/download to your local workplace.
- Download the latest .Net SDK and Visual Studio/Code.

## Standalone
1. You may need a running instance of MsSQL, with appropriate migrations initialized.
	- You can run just the DB on docker. For that, you have to change your connection string to "Server=127.0.0.1;Database=master;User=sa;Password=Yourpassword123‚Äù and run the following command: ``docker-compose up -d db-server``. Doing that, the application will be able to reach de container of the db server.
	- If you want, you can change the DatabaseExtension to use UseInMemoryDatabase, instead of Mssql.
2. Go to the src/Boilerplate.Api folder and run ``dotnet run``, or, in visual studio set the api project as startup and run as console or docker (not IIS).
3. Visit http://localhost:5000/api-docs or https://localhost:5001/api-docs to access the application's swagger.

## Docker
1. Run ``docker-compose up -d`` in the root directory, or, in visual studio, set the docker-compose project as startup and run. This should start the application and DB.
 - 1. For docker-compose, you should run this command on the root folder: ``dotnet dev-certs https -ep https/aspnetapp.pfx -p yourpassword``
		Replace "yourpassword" with something else in this command and the docker-compose.override.yml file.
This creates the https certificate.
2. Visit http://localhost:5000/api-docs or https://localhost:5001/api-docs to access the application's swagger.

## Running tests
In the root folder, run ``dotnet test``. This command will try to find all test projects associated with the sln file.

# This project contains:
- SwaggerUI
- EntityFramework
- AutoMapper
- Generic repository (to easily bootstrap a CRUD repository)
- Serilog with request logging and easily configurable sinks
- .Net Dependency Injection
- Resource filtering
- Response compression
- Response pagination
- CI (Github Actions)
- Unit tests
- Integration tests
- Container support with [docker](src/Boilerplate.Api/dockerfile) and [docker-compose](docker-compose.yml)


# Project Structure
1. Services
	- This folder stores your apis and any project that sends data to your users.
	1. Boilerplate.Api
		- This is the main api project. Here are all the controllers and initialization for the api that will be used.
	2. docker-compose
		- This project exists to allow you to run docker-compose with Visual Studio. It contains a reference to the docker-compose file and will build all the projects dependencies and run it.
2. Application
	-  This folder stores all data transformations between your api and your domain layer. It also contains your business logic.
3. Domain
	- This folder contains your business models, enums and common interfaces.
	1. Boilerplate.Domain.Core
		- Contains the base entity for all other domain entities, as well as the interface for the repository implementation.
	1. Boilerplate.Domain
		- Contains business models and enums.
4. Infra
	- This folder contains all data access repositories, database contexts, anything that reaches for outside data.
	1. Boilerplate.Infrastructure
		- This project contains the dbcontext, an generic implementation of repository pattern and a Hero(domain class) repository.


# Adopting to your project
1. Remove/Rename all hero related stuff to your needs.
2. Rename solution, projects, namespaces, and ruleset to your use.
3. Change the dockerfile and docker-compose.yml to your new csproj/folder names.
3. Give this repo a star!

# Migrations
1. To run migrations on this project, run the following command on the root folder: 
	- ``dotnet ef migrations add InitialCreate --startup-project .\src\Boilerplate.Api\ --project .\src\Boilerplate.Infrastructure\``

2. This command will set the entrypoint for the migration (the responsible to selecting the dbprovider { sqlserver, mysql, etc } and the connection string) and the project itself will be the infrastructure, which is where the dbcontext is.
